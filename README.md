# QLDC 2023 Levels

This repository has all of the levels submitted to SMW Central's "[Questionable Level Design Contest #2](https://smwc.me/t/123442)".

## Patching

To patch the entries individually, open `flips.exe` and follow the application as prompted to apply individual patches to your clean copy of Super Mario World to produce a patched ROM file you can use in the emulator or on the console of your choosing.

If you would like to use the script to patch only the award-winners, place your copy of Super Mario World here and rename it to `smw.sfc` and run the provided `patch_award_winners.bat` script by double-clicking it, Flips will take care of the rest.
